{"name":"Ecb","tagline":"ECB Main Repository","body":"### Welcome to the ECB Github Page\r\n\r\nECB stands for \"Emacs Code Browser\".  While Emacs already has good _editing_ support for many modes, its _browsing_ support is somewhat lacking.  That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.\r\n\r\nThe informational windows can contain:\r\n\r\n* A directory tree\r\n* A list of source files in the current directory (with full support and display of the VC-state)\r\n* A list of functions/classes/methods/etc. in the current file. (ECB uses CEDET-semantic, Imenu or tags for getting this list so all languages supported by any of these tools is automatically supported by ECB too)\r\n* A history of recently visited files (group able by several criteria)\r\n* A direct and auto-updated eco-window for semantic-analyzer for context analysis of source code\r\n* Speedbar support for conveniently navigating or operating on another frame\r\n* A _compilation_ window used for compilation and the use of other command-line utilities such as help, grep, etc.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible, even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.\r\n\r\nWhile ECB comes with a number of ready-made window layouts to choose from, the window layout is configurable to your desires.\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n\r\nThere are a number of important links to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n* [Main ECB Github Page:](http://ecb-home.github.io/ecb/) That is the current page you are on.  This will be utilized for release announcements and general information.\r\n* [ECB Github Repo:](https://github.com/ecb-home/ecb) This is the Github repository with the latest ECB code\r\n* ECB Latest Release (2.5) in [zip](https://github.com/ecb-home/ecb/zipball/2.5-dev) and [tarball](https://github.com/ecb-home/ecb/tarball/2.5-dev)\r\n* [ECB Wiki:](https://github.com/ecb-home/ecb/wiki) Where all documentation and other information is available\r\n* [ECB Issues:](https://github.com/ecb-home/ecb/issues) Where all issues, bugs, questions or feature requests should go in lieu of the SourceForge ECB mail list\r\n* [ECB Mail List (deprecated):](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ecb-list) There will still be responses to this mail list.  However, I'd like to move conversation to the issues tracker where ever possible.  It's traceable and verifiable as opposed to the ambiguities of a mail list.  I'm also [very concerned](http://www.howtogeek.com/218764/warning-donâ€™t-download-software-from-sourceforge-if-you-can-help-it/) about some of SourceForge's recent actions and want to rely upon them as little as possible.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
