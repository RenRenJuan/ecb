{"name":"Ecb","tagline":"ECB Main Repository","body":"### Welcome to the ECB Github Page\r\n\r\nECB stands for \"Emacs Code Browser\".  While Emacs already has good _editing_ support for many modes, its _browsing_ support is somewhat lacking.  That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.\r\n\r\nThe informational windows can contain:\r\n\r\n* A directory tree\r\n* A list of source files in the current directory (with full support and display of the VC-state)\r\n* A list of functions/classes/methods/etc. in the current file\r\n** ECB uses CEDET-semantic, Imenu or tags for getting this list so all languages supported by any of these tools is automatically supported by ECB too\r\n* A history of recently visited files (group able by several criteria)\r\n* A direct and auto-updated eco-window for semantic-analyzer for context analysis of source code\r\n* Speedbar support for conveniently navigating or operating on another frame\r\n* A _compilation_ window used for compilation and the use of other command-line utilities such as help, grep, etc.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible, even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.\r\n\r\nWhile ECB comes with a number of ready-made window layouts to choose from, the window layout is configurable to your desires.\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n\r\nThere are a number of important links to keep in mind.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
