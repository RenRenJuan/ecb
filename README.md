# Emacs Code Browser


## 2.50.2

> Loads via require without error or warning from this level of sources
> but there is warning not directly referencing ecb, nature TBD.

## Assessment

> Now understand that ECB is thoroughly bitrotted at least wrt GNU Emacs 26.1.
> This is compounded by migration of the depdendencies and a loose concept in
> the first place.

> I don't want to do anything more than make the original concept work in 
> the current target and expect to comment out a lot of stuff like the Xemacs
> support where warranted.

> A common and compounded anti-parttern, the original never reached a level
> of quality that would merit its upkeep and then the attempt to update didn
> do anything more than deal with the cedit et. al. migration into the main
> app.

> Undecided how I will proceed but will leave this fork in any case. Presume
> I will use unless an ensemble of current things works better.

## 2.50.1

  Assess worth of doing and state of other forks, begin corrections.
  State as of fork (2.50) is loads with errors. 
  Directory pane populates erratically but may be normal.
  Need to assess intended original function and what 2.50 changed
  and what makes sense now (emacs 26.1).
